,,"Quarkus is taking its act on the ""virtual"" road to Java user groups across the world. Each session will be approximately 90 mins with 3 distinct sections:
1) Introduction to Quarkus
2) Demo - exact demo is TBD but we will leverage existing Quarkus apps (coffee shop, To Do list, etc.)
3) Ask the Experts (don't be afraid of the word expert, everything is relative)

We Need Your Help! It is going to take the entire Quarkus team to make these events a success. Please consider signing up for as many sessions as you like.
* some JUGs requested to have native speaking presenters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
